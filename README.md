# Doctor Booking App

### Frameworks and Language Used

- **Frameworks**:
  - Spring Boot for building the application.
  - Java for the programming language.

### Dataflow Functions

1. **Controller**
   - Receives incoming HTTP requests.
   - Routes requests to appropriate service methods.
   - Handles input validation and transformation.
   - Returns HTTP responses to clients.

2. **Service**
   - Contains the core business logic.
   - Interacts with the repository for data retrieval and storage.
   - May perform data processing, transformation, and validation.
   - Provides the main functionality of the application.

3. **Repository**
   - Handles interactions with the database.
   - Performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data.
   - Translates between Java objects and database records.

4. **Database Design**
   - Defines the structure and relationships of database tables.
   - Determines how data is organized, stored, and retrieved.
   - May include entity-relationship diagrams, schema descriptions, or SQL scripts.

### Data Structures Used

- **Java Objects (POJOs)**: Used to model and represent data within the application.
- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: Used for data serialization, especially in API endpoints.
- **Database Tables**: Structured data storage in a relational database, typically using SQL schemas.

### Project Summary

This project utilizes Spring Boot and Java to create a web application. Here's an overview:

- **Frameworks and Language**: The application is built using Spring Boot and Java, providing a robust and efficient development platform.

- **Dataflow Functions**:
  - **Controller**: Responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, routing them to services, and managing responses.
  - **Service**: Houses the business logic, including data processing and interaction with the repository.
  - **Repository**: Handles database interactions, translating between Java objects and database records.
  - **Database Design**: Specifies the database schema and structure.

- **Data Structures Used**:
  - Java Objects for modeling data.
  - JSON for data serialization.
  - Relational database tables for structured data storage.

This project aims to demonstrate effective use of Spring Boot and Java for building a web application with a clear separation of concerns and well-defined data flow. The combination of frameworks and data structures chosen ensures flexibility, maintainability, and efficient data handling.
